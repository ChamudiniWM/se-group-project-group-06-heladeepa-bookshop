*By WM Chamudini, AMND Bandara, DAS Oshan, KPV Kumarage (May 2025)*

Designed and developed a full-stack e-commerce system for Heladeepa Bookshop, specializing in books and stationery. The platform includes customer-facing features such as product browsing, category filtering, wishlist, and payment integration. Admins can manage inventory, update stock, and process orders through a dedicated panel. Additional features include a booklist submission system, email notifications, and real-time order tracking. Built using React for the frontend and Spring Boot with MySQL for the backend.
